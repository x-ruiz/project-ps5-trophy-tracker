# PS5 Trophy Tracker (Sunset)

## Description
Attempted to create a simple web app that returns a users playstation trophy list, games, and trophy progress.

## Architecture and Documentation
![project-playstation-trophy-tracker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a0a935c-cbb3-4941-9077-4c1c26cbed0d)

## Results and Conclusion
PSN API authentication was broken in established psn-api javascript package. Since the PSN Api is not public facing, documentation was scarce and proved a major roadblock in the POC.
Decided to sunset this project and move on.
